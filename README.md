# KV Cache Runner

Modern AI workloads require KV cache infrastructure that delivers speed, scale,
and resilience.

KV Cache Runner (KVCR) reimagines KV cache as a system-wide distributed
resource: available across memory and storage tiers, resilient by design, and
managed holistically to unlock system-level optimizations and maximize
end-to-end performance.

KVCR is agentic-native and built to accelerate AI workloads of every kind.

## Architecture

KVCR is at its most powerful when working in tandem with a KV-aware request
router. The router knows where the KV cache resides and can provide the selected
worker with hints about where to retrieve it. The cache can be sourced locally
or from remote peers, within or across memory and storage tiers, or from any
combination of these sources.

KVCR leaves local KV cache offloading to host memory under the engine's control.
It focuses on system-level optimizations enabled by this architecture, including
cross-node KV cache sharing, KV-aware request load balancing, and KV cache
prefetching — all guided by the router’s system-wide view. By maximizing KV cache
reuse and overlapping cache onboarding with computation, KVCR reduces redundant
work and improves prefill efficiency.

KVCR is resilient by design. KVCR-Guard is a sidecar KVCR process operating in
active-passive mode and can outlive an engine failure. In such an event,
KVCR-Guard remains available as a remote source of KV cache, minimizing
disruption to serving in the face of failures.

KVCR provides a flexible policy interface that allows its behavior to be
customized for different workloads.

  with its core.

  for different workloads.

## Framework support

KVCR is vendor and framework agnostic, with no dependency on a specific request
router. The list below summarizes framework integrations that are complete or
in progress. We plan to extend support to additional frameworks and routers in
the future.

## Using KVCR

### Quick start

The [quick start](docs/quick-start.md) is a public preview that builds and runs
KVCR with vLLM, Dynamo, and NIXL using pinned source revisions and a compatible
base image. See the
[developer guide](docs/dev-guide.md#integrate-with-vllm-and-dynamo-optional)
for source installation and verification.

### Development

For local development, API lifecycle guidance, validation, integration, and
KVCR guard service usage, see the [developer guide](docs/dev-guide.md).

This research branch also contains an [online G2 resize prototype](docs/online-g2-resize.md),
with known review blockers; it is not a production-ready feature.

## License

KVCR is released under the Apache License 2.0. The full license text is in
[LICENSE](LICENSE).

KVCR package source files carry an SPDX Apache-2.0 identifier and the NVIDIA
copyright notice. The vLLM source files used in the public quick-start
build retain their Apache-2.0 contributor headers.

## Third-party software

vLLM and Dynamo are installed separately in the quick-start image and are not
bundled into the `kvcr` wheel. The build uses the public sources and
pinned revisions described in the [quick start](docs/quick-start.md).

KVCR declares runtime dependencies on `msgspec`, `pyzmq`, and `nixl`. Each is
installed from its own distribution under its own license. None of them are
redistributed by this repository or bundled into the `kvcr` wheel, which
packages only `src/kvcr`.
